#' hproj: henrik style project template
#'
#' This is a package for working with projects - which here means creating a
#' (statistical) report with R, knitr and git version control. There are
#' functions to create a certain directory structure and other very specific
#' things. Note; these are tailored after the idiosyncratic preferences of the
#' author. If for some strange reason you are interested, read the documentation
#' for \code{new_project} to get some idea.
